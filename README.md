# Slothful Slingshot

## What is Slothful Slingshot?

**Slothful Slingshot** is a program to find the smallest cost that must be spent to depart
from the starting point to the finish point through several catapults along the start point
to the finish point.

To make it easier to calculate the distance between starting point, finish point, and cata
-pults, we use the coordinate plane. The location of these points can be represented by
coordinate points which represented as (x, y).
