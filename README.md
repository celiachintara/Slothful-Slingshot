## What is Slothful Slingshot?

**Slothful Slingshot** is a program to find the smallest cost that must be spent to depart from the starting point to the finish point through several catapults along the start point to the finish point.

To make it easier to calculate the distance between starting point, finish point, and catapults, we use the coordinate plane. The location of these points can be represented by coordinate points which represented as (x, y).

This program implements the Breadth First Search(BFS) method to find the minimum cost needed from the start point to the finish point, with the help of functions that already exist in C languages, such as Priority Queue, Vector, and Struct.

Here is a testcase that you can try using our program.

Input:
```
5
10 10 1 1
8 8 7
8 3 7
3 8 7
5 5 5
3 3 7
-1
-1 -1 -1 -1
```

Output:
```
5.11
```

To read fully about details of our program, We have already made pdf file that can be
accessed above. The pdf file itself contains explanation and also observation of our
program.
